â€œ/etc/init.d/postgresql restart" => restart postgresql server.

psql -> pgsql command line

service postgresql status -> see if the database is running 

psql <database> -> psql mode for database, be careful.

createdb <database name> -> create database.

localhost is also known as 127.0.0.1, which helped me connect pgAdmin4 to my Postgres DB.


in psql mode:

\q OR ctrl + d -> quit to postgres

\h -> help for sql commands
